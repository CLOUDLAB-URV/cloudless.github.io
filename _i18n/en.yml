text_objectives: "The objective of the CLOUDLESS project is to develop an edge computing platform for the creation and deployment of open Data Spaces (International Data Spaces). The platform will follow a decentralized distributed architecture that offers event-based open discovery and interconnection services (data brokers) to different data consumers (data consumers) and data providers (data providers).
The architecture will also offer secure Cloud/Edge infrastructures that allow efficient data analysis (data connectors) based on variables such as locality, economic cost, privacy or latency.
The platform will be validated in different open data spaces such as citizen science, tourism or omics data (genomics and metabolomics)."

pyrun_text: "PyRun is defined as the world's first \"Serverless Python Studio\", a deep-tech platform that acts as an intelligent bridge between local code and the immense power of the cloud. Its critical importance lies in eliminating the \"complexity tax\": currently, data scientists and AI engineers lose up to 60% of their time configuring complex infrastructures instead of innovating. PyRun solves this by democratizing supercomputing; it allows any Python user, without DevOps knowledge, to run their scripts on clouds like AWS or IBM with a single click, while the platform automatically manages the entire server lifecycle, ensuring that technical talent focuses purely on creating value rather than \"connecting cables\"."
